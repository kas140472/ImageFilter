# Image Filter
This Image Filter webpage allows the user to upload an image and subject it to various interesting filters. It uses the dukelearntoprogram SimpleImage library's methods to manipulate image pixels and JavaScript functions to code various filters. Part of w3Schools' CSS template has been used for webpage design.
